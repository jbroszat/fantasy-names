fantasy-names
=============

A web application to show lists of or randomly generate names for PCs or NPCs of the german RPG Das Schwarze Auge, according to the rules described in Das Buch der Namen by Stephanie von Ribbeck.

Since this is about the german issue of the rpg it's all in german.

The application is still in development, but this first version should be fully funcional.

While this version is based on PHP and JavaScript, using jQuery Mobile for the layout and user interface, and thusly only usable with a internet connection, the target application will be a downloadable application running completely on a mobile device. Hopefully any mobile device.
